# AlTar 2.0 Documentation

AlTar is a software package which solves inverse problems with Bayesian inference. It is named after the Spanish-French physicist [Albert Tarantola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Tarantola), for his pioneering work on the Bayesian perspective of inverse problems.

AlTar is primarily based on the [Cascading Adaptive Tempered Metropolis In Parallel (CATMIP) algorithm](https://thesis.library.caltech.edu/5918/).
