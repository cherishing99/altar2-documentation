# AlTar 2.0

## About AlTar
AlTar (Al-Tar) is a software package to solve inverse problems with Bayesian inference. It is named after the Spanish-French physicist [Albert Tarantola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Tarantola), for his pioneering work on the Bayesian perspective of inverse problems.

AlTar focuses on the [Cascading Adaptive Tempered Metropolis In Parallel (CATMIP) algorithm](https://thesis.library.caltech.edu/5918/), a multi-level Markov Chain Monte-Carlo method.
